JVJC;NESSA;Although her Galarian name is only four-characters, which matches neither or English name “NESSA” or Japanese name “Rurina”, it’s more than likely it’s just the first four letters in her romaji name, “RURI”. Alternatively, it might be that NESSA had a “prototype” Japanese name which was only four romaji characters long, which her Galarian name was based on, but then it was later changed to “Rurina”, only to forget to change her Galarian name likewise.;Galar

47E Y 47E H;TEAM YELL;The Team Yell logo uses the same symbol as the Dragon-type Gym symbol seen all over the place. However, since “Dragon” in Galarian is X9CDJA, and none of those characters match either Y or H, then… your guess is as good as mine! Correction, turns out the Team Yell logo is just the Dark type uniform. So 47E is “Aku”, not “Dan”.;Galar

XW N1H^F;MC INSURANCE;So clearly XW is supposed to be “MC”, given its use as the first letters in “Macro Cosmos” (XVCYQ WQE+QE);Galar
XW uo2zp;MC BROKERAGE;This also means “N1H^F” is “Insurance”, while “UO2ZP” is “Brokerage”. It’s worth noting that “Insurance” in Japanese is “hoken” (保険), while “Brokerage” is (most likely) “chūkai” (仲介)… and that’s maybe if we treat “ch” as a single character, and thus both words fit the 5 Galarian letter form. But this is just a guess… it’s worth nothing that neither words are seen in any junk text.;Galar
XJ;HAMMERLOCKE UNIVERSITY;It’s only the initials, but X is definitely XDEBWLA (Hamerlocke), while J is “University” (however it’s spelled in Galarian). Now consider that the Japanese word for “university” is 大学 daigaku, and the Japanese word for the Electric type, denki, is spelled in Galarian with a J as well (namely, JEMXL). So, again, this kind of stuff proves that there is SOME consistency in these words… but what??;Galar

Bur since it’s written in Katakana, I figure it’s intended to be understood as the six-character English word “Dragon” instead. This in turn suggests that the Galarian words for Psychic and Normal are based on the English translations of their Japanese names, versus the romaji forms—and thus are “Esper” and “Normal” versus “Esupa” and “Nomaru“;Galar

However, when I saw the Galarian word for “Pokémon” again, it was spelled with a u, which… I mean, I guess if it was written with neon letters, it too would have an empty hole at the top… so was the original neon letter supposed to be a u or a 0 with a hole in it?;Galar

X()A OH125;;Company name;Galar
R398B XWDV4E;;In Japanese and Korean, the Academy is known as “Grape Academy”, so I can easily imagine at least the first word to be “GRAPE”.;Paldea
J39QR XWDV4E;;In Japanese and Korean, the Academy is known as “Orange Academy”, but I don’t see how either of those words fit in those Paldean words…;Paldea
R398B XWDV4E TXL3L89W;;While the top two text is unique (Paldean for “Uva [Grape] Academy”), the bottom text was seen in generic text a couple times in Galar;Paldea
V8CLM;;Galar was clearly written as GA9A4. But I just don’t see it in the name of Paldea. Someone suggested that the word shown is simply “CARTA” (Spanish for “Map”) but… I dunno.;Paldea
WEBMQX;;This is the big green text seen in all Pokédex entries. The text below, however, is generic (see below) Now a few people on the PA! Discord has suggested that THIS is the word for “Paldea”, not the one above…. and I’m inclined to believe it. However, there is no evidence of this being the case, such as a map of Paldea with these words beneath it, although the next entry may be a fair point just the same. Another alternative that Kinnit mentioned to me on Discord is that this is the Paldean word for “Pokémon”, given….;Paldea
WEBMCJ BKQJ;;This is on the League building, sharing the same four letters as on the Pokédex title. Maybe the four letters mean “Poke-“? But wait a sec, “Pokémon” in Galarian/Paldean is already established to be ?wru#wt… so what’s WEBMCJ/WEBMQX? Maybe, as Kinnit also suggested, that Galarian and Paldean could be treated as different languages, and simply this IS the Paldean word for Pokémon? Maybe, given with the word above, is “Paldea”? After all, this could be the word (in Spanish) “PALDEA LIGA”, or “Paldea League”…? After all b = L and J = A in both (well, if you ignore the E = A bit).;Paldea
W87;;Compare/Contrast with 7Z0652OP DV4 seen in Galar Region Gyms, as well as how both W87, WEBMQX and WEBMCJ all start with the same character. Maybe w87 is an initialism?;Paldea

j6uh V8CLM9S7CK+BTY;;Nothing in this text ever appeared before, although K+BTY appears in an Iono advertising (see below);Paldea
LM9S7C (MA);;This almost looks like some kind of public service notice (“Please don’t step on Dedenne!”), especially with the MA logo in the bottom-left corner which looks like an “Ad Council” logo.;Paldea
+BTY9x3v;;The 9x3v bit at the end is new, while +BTY was seen the above Stir-fried Rice advertisement.;Paldea

RW9;;One instance of RW9 appears in Galar, but I feel like that might be a coincidence.;Paldea
9KE MAQ;;This is the name of Ballonlea in Galar (technically 9KEMA). Was this a town of transplants from Galar??;Paldea
A4LA 0;;Galar is strange, words like A4LA are clearly existing words (in this case, obviously “AREA”). And yet other words aren’t anything like an existing word. I don’t get why it be like this…!!;Paldea

FC^1n n1^CF;;Although it uses Galarian letters, technically those kind of Asian-style signs are written right-to-left, so maybe it’s supposed to be the bottom?;Paldea
K+BTY J5UP1;;K+BTY appears in the Pincurchin Fried Rice Advert seen in the Pokémon Center banner ads, but is otherwise a new word not seen in Sword/Shield. Iono’s logo in the upper-left corner, however, uses existing text (see “Iono’s livestream logo” below for more info);Paldea
D+OX ZU24+O VV^63 9on6^ ou5 A5FN2IO2^!;;The poster next to the “whiteboard” in the history room. This text has been seen in generic locations in the Galar region and elsewhere, such as on a few t-shirt designs;Paldea

QKLRE8 RE;;This almost looks like it says “Nintendo TM“;Paldea
QD7S9X;;Only QD7S9/QD7S has been seen before.;Paldea

Khfu5i 712n;;Or maybe they’re starter Pokémon breeding authentication certificates? Either way the texture is flipped horizontally. What’s crazy is that, despite the fact that you’ll never see this detail in-game, each of the three awards/certificates have specifically different text. Sure it’s all Lorem Ipsum text, but still…! I color coded them on the left, if they’re black then they’re the same across all three, but green, blue and red text means it’s unique for the left, center and right award, respectively.;Paldea
9EMRE;;This word previously appeared outside every Gym in Galar. Meanwhile, the 9EMRE stores have a bunch of words which I’ll write down later.;Paldea

Most of the names are old but the second one appears to be unique. How odd… The third one is seen in the Alolan text above… maybe it means “beach-front property”?
